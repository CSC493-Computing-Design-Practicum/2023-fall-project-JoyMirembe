## Software Architectural Design

### 1. User Authentication Component
This component will handle user registration and login. It will interact with the database to store and retrieve user information. In Node.js, I will use a class `User` with possible methods like `register()`, `login()`, and `logout()`.

### 2. Income Tracker Component
This component will allow users to input their income. It will interact with the database to store and update income entries. In React, I will have a component `IncomeTracker` with methods `addIncome()`, `editIncome()`, and `deleteIncome()`.

### 3. Expense Tracker Component
This component will allow users to input their expenses and categorize them (e.g., food, rent, tuition). It will interact with the database to store and update expense entries. In React, I will have a component `ExpenseTracker` with methods like `addExpense()`, `editExpense()`, `deleteExpense()`, and `categorizeExpense()`.

### 4. Visualization Component
This component will provide a visual representation (e.g., pie chart, bar graph) of the user's income and expenses. It will retrieve financial data from the database and use it to generate graphs. In React, I will have a component `Visualization` with a method like `generateGraph()`.

### 5. Budgeting Tips Component
This component will analyze the user's spending habits and provide budgeting tips. It will retrieve financial data from the database for analysis. In React, I will have a component `BudgetingTips` with a method like `generateTips()`.

### 6. Database Component
This component will handle all interactions with the database, including storing and retrieving data. In Node.js, I will use a class `Database` with methods like `storeData()`, `retrieveData()`, `updateData()`, and `deleteData()`.

The control hierarchy starts from the User Authentication Component, followed by the Income Tracker and Expense Tracker Components. The Visualization and Budgeting Tips Components will depend on the data provided by these trackers. The Database Component serves all other components.
