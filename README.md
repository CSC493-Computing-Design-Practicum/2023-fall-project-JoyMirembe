## Description/Motivation

**Project Proposal: Unicoin - A Student Budgeting App**

Unicoin is a mobile application designed to empower students to take control of their financial health. The app aims to simplify budgeting, saving, and financial planning for students, providing them with the tools they need to manage their money effectively.

The core functionality of Unicoin includes budget tracking, goal setting, and financial education. Users can input their income and expenses, categorize their spending, and track their progress towards financial goals. The app also includes educational resources to help users learn more about personal finance.

What sets Unicoin apart is its focus on the unique financial challenges faced by students. From budgeting for textbooks and meals, Unicoin is tailored to the student experience. It also includes features like bank account integration for real-time tracking of transactions, a user-friendly interface, and  security measures to protect user data.

Unicoin is not just useful - it's also interesting and fun. The app gamifies saving and budgeting, rewarding users for achieving their financial goals. It also includes a community feature where users can share tips and learn from each other, making finance management less intimidating and more collaborative.

This project is an exciting opportunity to explore the intersection of finance and technology, and to create a tool that can make a real difference in students' lives. By developing Unicoin, I hope to promote financial literacy among students and help them build strong financial habits that will benefit them long after they graduate.
