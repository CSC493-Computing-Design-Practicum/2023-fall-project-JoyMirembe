## Description/Motivation
  
**Project Proposal: Unicoin - A Student Budgeting App**

Unicoin is a mobile application designed to empower students to take control of their financial health. The app aims to simplify budgeting, saving, and financial planning for students, providing them with the tools they need to manage their money effectively.

The core functionality of Unicoin includes budget tracking, goal setting, and financial education. Users can input their income and expenses, categorize their spending, and track their progress towards financial goals. The app also includes educational resources to help users learn more about personal finance.

What sets Unicoin apart is its focus on the unique financial challenges faced by students. From budgeting for textbooks and meals, Unicoin is tailored to the student experience. It also includes features like bank account integration for real-time tracking of transactions, a user-friendly interface, and  security measures to protect user data.

Unicoin is not just useful - it's also interesting and fun. The app gamifies saving and budgeting, rewarding users for achieving their financial goals. It also includes a community feature where users can share tips and learn from each other, making finance management less intimidating and more collaborative.

This project is an exciting opportunity to explore the intersection of finance and technology, and to create a tool that can make a real difference in students' lives. By developing Unicoin, I hope to promote financial literacy among students and help them build strong financial habits that will benefit them long after they graduate.

### Scope
The scope of Unicoin is to include features such as expense tracking, budget planning, savings goals, and spending insights. These features are designed to empower students to take control of their finances by providing them with the tools they need to track their expenses, plan their budgets, save for their goals, and understand their spending habits. Out of scope for this project are features like integration with bank accounts, peer comparison, and a rewards system. While these features could enhance the user experience and functionality of Unicoin, they are currently not planned to be included due to time constraints and additional complexities.

### Vision
Unicoin is designed to create a user-friendly budgeting app specifically designed for college students. My goal is to empower students to take control of their finances, helping them navigate through their college years without the constant worry of overspending. With Unicoin, I envision this as an app where every student can easily track their expenses, plan their budgets, and save for their goals, all in one place.


### Prerequisites

1. **Web Development Languages**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are fundamental to building the structure, style, and functionality of the web app.

2. **Backend Programming**: A server-side language like Python, Ruby, Java, or Node.js will be needed to handle data processing and storage.

3. **Database Systems**: A database system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB will be necessary for storing and managing user data.

4. **Web Frameworks**: Utilizing web frameworks like Django (Python), Rails (Ruby), Express (Node.js), or Angular/React/Vue (JavaScript) can expedite the development process.

5. **API Integration**: Knowledge of working with APIs is crucial if there's a plan to integrate with bank accounts or other external services.

6. **Web Security Practices**: Given that sensitive financial data will be handled, understanding of web security practices is essential.

7. **Version Control Systems**: A system like Git would be beneficial for managing changes and versioning of the codebase.

8. **Deployment and Hosting Platforms**: Familiarity with platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku is required to deploy the web app and make it accessible to users.

9. **UI/UX Design Skills**: While not a technical prerequisite, good user interface and user experience design are crucial in making the app intuitive and user-friendly.
