**CSC493 â€“ Weekly Reports**

**Name:** Joy Mirembe

**Week:** Seven

**Part 1: Weekly Progress Report**

**Accomplishments:** 

This week was primarily focused on the backend development of the Unicoin project. I made sdignificant progress in refining my backend code and enhancing its functionality. I have continued working on my backend using Node.js. I have also worked on middleware functions which I'm working on to handle requests and responses. I have also continued working on the process of integrating MongoDB with the application, marking a crucial step in the project's development. I chose MongoDB for its flexibility and scalability, I also used Mongoose as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library.

In addition to this, I added routes to handle different endpoints in the application. These routes were designed to handle various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, allowing for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on both incomes and expenses.

**Challenges:** The main challenge I encountered during this week was setting up and integrating MongoDB with the application. As this was the first instance of deeply using MongoDB, it required a considerable amount of time to understand its operation and effective utilization in a Node.js environment. 

**Desired Discussion Points:** It would be beneficial to discuss the technicalities of MongoDB usage in a Node.js application. Understanding best practices, efficient schema design, and effective query handling would be advantageous for the project.

**Future Goal:** The goal for the upcoming week is to continue developing the backend code with a focus on database operations. The aim is to finalize the database schema in MongoDB based on the classes identified in my design document. Additionally, plans are in place to start integrating the frontend with the backend by making API calls from React components.

**Part 2: Time Reporting**

**Time Spent:** The previous week's work was divided among various tasks. A significant portion of time was dedicated to refining the backend code, implementing middleware functions, adding routes for different endpoints, and initiating the process of integrating MongoDB with the application.

**Weekly Total Time Spent:** 7 hours

**Total Project Time Spent:** 33 hours

Rubric:

The following rubric will be used, but they might change as needed.
Accomplishments (3 points) 
1 point for a general description of progress, 2 points for specifics on progress, 3 points for specifics AND referring to previous targets and explaining how currently accomplishments build on previous ones.
Challenges (3 points)
1 point for mentioning there are roadblocks, 2 points for specifics, 3 points for specifics AND what was done already to try to overcome them.

Desired discussion points (2 points)
1 point for at least one relevant discussion point as a general question, 2 points for relevant discussion points with specifics
Future Goals (2 points)
1 point for concrete future targets (i.e. "working more on the project" is a zero, but "working on getting component X to interface with component Y" suffices), 2 points for tying in the targets with what was hopefully discussed in the meeting.
Time Spent (3 points)

1 point for including general statements of how much time was spent ("4 hours on coding"), 2 points for splitting time into specific parts ("1.5 hours on research on component X, 1 hour coding, 2.5 hours debugging"), 3 points for specific parts and details on the pieces ("1.5 hours researching Turtle interface for drawing concentric circles given inputs from the user, 1 hour coding function X that used that interface, 2.5 hours testing function X by giving it multiple values and fixing errors for values A, B, C, and D")
Weekly Total Time (1 point)

Total Project Time (2 points)
1 point for summing the values correctly, 2 points for the total time AND reflection on progress (you are confident to fit the target and if not, what course corrections you anticipate needing to make)
