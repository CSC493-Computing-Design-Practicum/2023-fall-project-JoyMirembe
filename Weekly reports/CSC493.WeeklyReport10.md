**CSC493 – Weekly Reports**

**Your name:** Joy Mirembe

**Week:** Ten

**Part 1: Weekly Progress Report**

**Accomplishments:** What did you accomplish since the last class meeting?

Since the last class meeting, I have set up the basic structure of the frontend using React. This involved creating various components for displaying incomes and expenses.
In addition to setting up the structure, I have also started exploring integrating these components with the backend by making API calls. This integration is crucial for the functionality of the app as it’ll allow the frontend and backend to communicate effectively.

However, working on my frontend has been extremely challenging for me; it’s required a lot of debugging. I spent over 6 hours debugging to ensure that the app runs smoothly and as expected. Despite these challenges, I remained committed to my goal and was able to make substantial progress.


**Challenges:** What are your current roadblocks?

My current roadblock is a series of bugs that are preventing my frontend code from being displayed in my React app. Debugging these issues has been a time-consuming process, but it is a necessary step to ensure the functionality and reliability of the app.
These bugs are proving to be quite challenging, but I am determined to overcome them. I am currently in the process of identifying the root cause of these bugs and exploring potential solutions. I am confident that with continued effort and persistence, I will be able to resolve these issues and move forward with my project.
 

**Desired Discussion Points:** Do you have any desired discussion points that are not related to roadblocks?

 how to fix my bugs
 
**Future Goal:** What do you plan to accomplish before our next class meeting? These plans should be related to roadblocks or discussion points. If you plan to change direction, explain why.

 In the upcoming week, my primary focus will be on addressing these bugs and ensuring that my frontend code is displayed correctly in the app. I am hopeful that I will be able to overcome this roadblock and make further progress on my student budgeting app. 
 

**Part 2: Time Reporting**

**Time Spent:** Briefly explain how much time you spent on your project. If you worked on multiple components, each should get a detailed summary.

Time Spent: Over the past week, I have dedicated a significant amount of time to working on my student budgeting app. Here’s a breakdown of how I spent my time:
Frontend Development: I spent a considerable amount of time setting up the basic structure of the frontend using React. This involved creating various components for displaying incomes and expenses. The process was quite involved and required a deep understanding of React and its component-based architecture. I estimate that I spent about 3 hours on this task.
Backend Integration: Once the basic structure of the frontend was set up, I started integrating these components with the backend by making API calls. This was a crucial step in ensuring that the frontend and backend could communicate effectively. I spent approximately 2 hours on this task.
Debugging: I encountered several bugs that prevented my frontend code from being displayed in my React app. Debugging these issues was a time-consuming process, but it was necessary to ensure the functionality and reliability of the app. I spent over 3 hours debugging these issues.
In total, I spent approximately 8 hours working on my project over the past week. 


**Weekly Total Time Spent:**

8 hours

**Total Project Time Spent:**

53 hours- I’m currently on track with my project timeline.

**Rubric:**

The following rubric will be used:

- **Accomplishments (3 points):** 1 point for a general description of progress, 2 points for specifics on progress, 3 points for specifics AND referring to previous targets and explaining how currently accomplishments build on previous ones.
- **Challenges (3 points):** 1 point for mentioning there are roadblocks, 2 points for specifics, 3 points for specifics AND what was done already to try to overcome them.
- **Desired discussion points (2 points):** 1 point for at least one relevant discussion point as a general question, 2 points for relevant discussion points with specifics.
- **Future Goals (2 points):** 1 point for concrete future targets (i.e. "working more on the project" is a zero, but "working on getting component X to interface with component Y" suffices), 2 points for tying in the targets with what was hopefully discussed in the meeting.
- **Time Spent (3 points):** 1 point for including general statements of how much time was spent ("4 hours on coding"), 2 points for splitting time into specific parts ("1.5 hours on research on component X, 1 hour coding, 2.5 hours debugging"), 3 points for specific parts and details on the pieces ("1.5 hours researching Turtle interface for drawing concentric circles given inputs from the user, 1 hour coding function X that used that interface, 2.5 hours testing function X by giving it multiple values and fixing errors for values A, B, C, and D").
- **Weekly Total Time (1 point)**
- **Total Project Time (2 points):** 1 point for summing the values correctly, 2 points for the total time AND reflection on progress (you are confident to fit the target and if not, what course corrections you anticipate needing to make).
