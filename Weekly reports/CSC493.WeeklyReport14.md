**Part 1: Weekly Progress Report**

**Accomplishments:** What did you accomplish since the last class meeting?

Since our last class meeting, I have made substantial progress on the student expense tracking app. Here are my key accomplishments:

1. **Graphing Functionality:** I successfully added a graphing functionality to the app. This feature allows users to visualize their spending habits across different categories such as travel or education costs. It provides a clear and concise overview of where their money is going, which can help them manage their finances more effectively.

2. **Expense and Income Input:** I also created a page where users can input their expenses and incomes. This data is then added to the backend, ensuring that all financial information is stored securely and can be accessed when needed.

3. **Frontend and Backend Integration:** Lastly, I completed the integration of the frontend with the backend. This was a crucial step in ensuring that the app functions seamlessly and provides a smooth user experience.



**Challenges:** What are your current roadblocks?

I dont have any roadblocks at this point
 

**Desired Discussion Points:** Do you have any desired discussion points that are not related to roadblocks?

 None
 
**Future Goal:** What do you plan to accomplish before our next class meeting? These plans should be related to roadblocks or discussion points. If you plan to change direction, explain why.

 N/A

**Part 2: Time Reporting**

**Time Spent:** Briefly explain how much time you spent on your project. If you worked on multiple components, each should get a detailed summary.

Over the past week, I have dedicated a significant amount of time to different components of the student expense tracking app. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **Graphing Functionality:** I spent approximately **4 hours** on this component. The time was primarily used for designing the layout, coding the necessary functions, and testing the graph for any bugs or issues.

2. **Expense and Income Input:** This feature took around **4 hours** to implement. The time was spent on designing the input page, coding its functionality, and ensuring it integrates well with the backend.

3. **Frontend and Backend Integration:** Integrating the frontend with the backend took about **3 hours**. This involved coding the integration, testing it to ensure the frontend and backend communicate effectively, and debugging any issues that arose.

In total, I spent approximately **11 hours** on the project since our last class meeting. 


**Weekly Total Time Spent:**

11 hours

**Total Project Time Spent:**

82 hours- I’m currently on track with my project timeline.

**Rubric:**

The following rubric will be used:

- **Accomplishments (3 points):** 1 point for a general description of progress, 2 points for specifics on progress, 3 points for specifics AND referring to previous targets and explaining how currently accomplishments build on previous ones.
- **Challenges (3 points):** 1 point for mentioning there are roadblocks, 2 points for specifics, 3 points for specifics AND what was done already to try to overcome them.
- **Desired discussion points (2 points):** 1 point for at least one relevant discussion point as a general question, 2 points for relevant discussion points with specifics.
- **Future Goals (2 points):** 1 point for concrete future targets (i.e. "working more on the project" is a zero, but "working on getting component X to interface with component Y" suffices), 2 points for tying in the targets with what was hopefully discussed in the meeting.
- **Time Spent (3 points):** 1 point for including general statements of how much time was spent ("4 hours on coding"), 2 points for splitting time into specific parts ("1.5 hours on research on component X, 1 hour coding, 2.5 hours debugging"), 3 points for specific parts and details on the pieces ("1.5 hours researching Turtle interface for drawing concentric circles given inputs from the user, 1 hour coding function X that used that interface, 2.5 hours testing function X by giving it multiple values and fixing errors for values A, B, C, and D").
- **Weekly Total Time (1 point)**
- **Total Project Time (2 points):** 1 point for summing the values correctly, 2 points for the total time AND reflection on progress (you are confident to fit the target and if not, what course corrections you anticipate needing to make).
