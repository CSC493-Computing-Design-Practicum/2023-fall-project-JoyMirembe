**CSC493 – Weekly Reports**

**Your name:** Joy Mirembe

**Week:** Eight

**Part 1: Weekly Progress Report**

**Accomplishments:** 
This week, I made significant progress on the Unicoin project. I completed working on my backend, which was a major milestone. I successfully implemented features to add incomes and expenses, as well as delete and view them. This has resulted in a working backend that can handle various financial transactions (for incomes and expenses). Also, I have successfully connected my backend to my MongoDB database. This was a crucial step as it allows for persistent storage of data. Now, I'm able to see both my incomes and expenses in my database, which is a successful integration of the backend with the database.

**Challenges:** 
As I transition to working on the frontend of the Unicoin project, I'm faced with the challenge of familiarizing myself with React. As this is my first time using React for a project, there's a steep learning curve involved. Understanding the nuances of React, its component-based architecture, and how to effectively use state and props are some of the areas I'm focusing on.

**Desired Discussion Points:** 
A key discussion point for me at this stage of the project is understanding how to effectively integrate my backend and frontend. This involves understanding how to make API calls from React components, handle responses, and update component state accordingly.

**Future Goal:** 
For the upcoming week, my plan is to dive into working on my frontend. This will involve setting up the basic structure of the frontend using React. I plan to create various components for displaying incomes and expenses and start integrating these components with the backend by making API calls.

**Part 2: Time Reporting**

**Time Spent:** 
This week’s work was divided among various tasks. Approximately 5 hours were dedicated to refining the backend code which included implementing features for adding, deleting, and viewing incomes and expenses. The remaining 3 hours were spent setting up MongoDB, learning how to use it effectively, and integrating it with my backend.

**Weekly Total Time Spent:** 8 hours

**Total Project Time Spent:** 38 hours- I’m currently on track with my project timeline.

Rubric:
The following rubric will be used, but they might change as needed.
Accomplishments (3 points) 
1 point for a general description of progress, 2 points for specifics on progress, 3 points for specifics AND referring to previous targets and explaining how currently accomplishments build on previous ones.
Challenges (3 points)
1 point for mentioning there are roadblocks, 2 points for specifics, 3 points for specifics AND what was done already to try to overcome them.
Desired discussion points (2 points)
1 point for at least one relevant discussion point as a general question, 2 points for relevant discussion points with specifics
Future Goals (2 points)
1 point for concrete future targets (i.e. "working more on the project" is a zero, but "working on getting component X to interface with component Y" suffices), 2 points for tying in the targets with what was hopefully discussed in the meeting.
Time Spent (3 points)
1 point for including general statements of how much time was spent ("4 hours on coding"), 2 points for splitting time into specific parts ("1.5 hours on research on component X, 1 hour coding, 2.5 hours debugging"), 3 points for specific parts and details on the pieces ("1.5 hours researching Turtle interface for drawing concentric circles given inputs from the user, 1 hour coding function X that used that interface, 2.5 hours testing function X by giving it multiple values and fixing errors for values A, B, C, and D")
Weekly Total Time (1 point)
Total Project Time (2 points)
1 point for summing the values correctly, 2 points for the total time AND reflection on progress (you are confident to fit the target and if not, what course corrections you anticipate needing to make)
