**Your name:** Joy Mirembe

**Week:** Twelve

**Part 1: Weekly Progress Report**

**Accomplishments:** What did you accomplish since the last class meeting?

Since our last class meeting, I have made significant progress on the student expense tracking app. Here are my key accomplishments:

1. **Dashboard Development:** I am making significant progress on the dashboard components of the app. This involves designing and implementing various elements to ensure a user-friendly interface and smooth navigation.

2. **Moving Orb Addition:** To enhance the visual appeal and interactive nature of the app, I am also working on a moving orb that floats around in the background. This feature not only adds a dynamic element to the app but also makes the user experience more engaging.

3. **Profile Picture Integration:** I have also made significant progress in integrating the functionality of adding a user's profile picture. This personalizes the user's experience and makes the app more tailored to the individual user.

These accomplishments have brought me one step closer to the final version of the app. 

**Challenges:** What are your current roadblocks?

My current roadblock is a series of bugs that I keep encountering, but i solve these as i go.
 

**Desired Discussion Points:** Do you have any desired discussion points that are not related to roadblocks?

 how to fix my bugs
 
**Future Goal:** What do you plan to accomplish before our next class meeting? These plans should be related to roadblocks or discussion points. If you plan to change direction, explain why.

 In the upcoming week, my primary focus will be on addressing these bugs and ensuring that my frontend code is displayed correctly in the app. I am hopeful that I will be able to overcome this roadblock and make further progress on my student budgeting app. 
 

**Part 2: Time Reporting**

**Time Spent:** Briefly explain how much time you spent on your project. If you worked on multiple components, each should get a detailed summary.

Over the past week, I have dedicated a significant amount of time to different components of the student expense tracking app. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **Dashboard Development:** I spent approximately **5 hours** on this component. The time was primarily used for designing the layout, coding the necessary functions, and testing the dashboard for any bugs or issues.

2. **Moving Orb Addition:** This feature took around **3 hours** to implement. The time was spent on designing the orb, coding its movement, and ensuring it doesn't interfere with the functionality of other components.

3. **Profile Picture Integration:** Integrating the profile picture functionality took about **2 hours**. This involved coding the feature, integrating it with the user's profile, and testing it to ensure the pictures are displayed correctly.

In total, I spent approximately **10 hours** on the project since our last class meeting. This time was well-spent as it allowed me to make substantial progress on the app.


**Weekly Total Time Spent:**

10 hours

**Total Project Time Spent:**

71 hours- I’m currently on track with my project timeline.

**Rubric:**

The following rubric will be used:

- **Accomplishments (3 points):** 1 point for a general description of progress, 2 points for specifics on progress, 3 points for specifics AND referring to previous targets and explaining how currently accomplishments build on previous ones.
- **Challenges (3 points):** 1 point for mentioning there are roadblocks, 2 points for specifics, 3 points for specifics AND what was done already to try to overcome them.
- **Desired discussion points (2 points):** 1 point for at least one relevant discussion point as a general question, 2 points for relevant discussion points with specifics.
- **Future Goals (2 points):** 1 point for concrete future targets (i.e. "working more on the project" is a zero, but "working on getting component X to interface with component Y" suffices), 2 points for tying in the targets with what was hopefully discussed in the meeting.
- **Time Spent (3 points):** 1 point for including general statements of how much time was spent ("4 hours on coding"), 2 points for splitting time into specific parts ("1.5 hours on research on component X, 1 hour coding, 2.5 hours debugging"), 3 points for specific parts and details on the pieces ("1.5 hours researching Turtle interface for drawing concentric circles given inputs from the user, 1 hour coding function X that used that interface, 2.5 hours testing function X by giving it multiple values and fixing errors for values A, B, C, and D").
- **Weekly Total Time (1 point)**
- **Total Project Time (2 points):** 1 point for summing the values correctly, 2 points for the total time AND reflection on progress (you are confident to fit the target and if not, what course corrections you anticipate needing to make).
