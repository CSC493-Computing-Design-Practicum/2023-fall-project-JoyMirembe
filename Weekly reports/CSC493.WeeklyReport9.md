**CSC493 – Weekly Reports**

**Your name:** Joy Mirembe

**Week:** Nine

**Part 1: Weekly Progress Report**

**Accomplishments:** What did you accomplish since the last class meeting?

This week, I made significant progress in setting up the necessary tools and structure for the front-end development of my project, UniCoin. One of my key accomplishments was the successful installation of several npm packages that are crucial to my project. These include axios for making HTTP requests, chart.js and react-chartjs-2 for creating charts and graphs, moment for handling dates and times, react as the foundational JavaScript library, react-datepicker for selecting dates, and styled-components for styling my components. These tools will greatly enhance the functionality and user experience of UniCoin.

In addition to this, I created some essential directories for my app. I set up a components directory where I will store all the reusable components that make up the user interface of UniCoin. I also created a styles directory where I will keep both global and local styles. This structure will help keep my code organized and maintainable.

Overall, this week was about laying a solid foundation for the front-end development of UniCoin. With these tools and structures in place, I am now well-equipped to start building out the user interface of the app.

**Challenges:** What are your current roadblocks?

Designing the user interface components has proven to be a complex task. I’ve come to quickly learn that it’s not just about making the app look good - it also needs to be intuitive and user-friendly. Balancing aesthetics with functionality is a challenge that I am still working on.

Lastly, managing both global and local styles in my styles directory has been hard, so i've had to keep ensuring consistency in design while allowing for component-specific styles 

**Desired Discussion Points:** Do you have any desired discussion points that are not related to roadblocks?

A key discussion point for me at this stage of the project is understanding how to effectively integrate my backend and frontend. This involves understanding how to make API calls from React components, handle responses, and update component state accordingly.

**Future Goal:** What do you plan to accomplish before our next class meeting? These plans should be related to roadblocks or discussion points. If you plan to change direction, explain why.

This was a goal from last week that I don't think I was able to fully accomplish so I;m carrying it forward: For the upcoming week, my plan is to dive into working on my frontend. This will involve setting up the basic structure of the frontend using React. I plan to create various components for displaying incomes and expenses and start integrating these components with the backend by making API calls.

**Part 2: Time Reporting**

**Time Spent:** Briefly explain how much time you spent on your project. If you worked on multiple components, each should get a detailed summary.

This week, I dedicated approximately 7 hours to different aspects of my project, UniCoin.
npm Packages: A significant portion of this time was spent on installing and understanding the npm packages that are crucial for my project. This included axios, chart.js, moment, react, react-chartjs-2, react-datepicker, and styled-components. Each package required time to understand its functionalities and syntax.
Directory Structure: I also dedicated time to setting up the directory structure for my app. This involved creating a components directory for storing reusable components and a styles directory for managing both global and local styles.
Overall, the time was well-spent as it allowed me to lay a solid foundation for the front-end development of UniCoin.

**Weekly Total Time Spent:**

This week, I spent a total of **8 hours** on my project, UniCoin.

**Total Project Time Spent:**

So far, I have spent a total of **38 hours** on my project. I'm currently on track with my project timeline, which is a positive sign. 

**Rubric:**

The following rubric will be used:

- **Accomplishments (3 points):** 1 point for a general description of progress, 2 points for specifics on progress, 3 points for specifics AND referring to previous targets and explaining how currently accomplishments build on previous ones.
- **Challenges (3 points):** 1 point for mentioning there are roadblocks, 2 points for specifics, 3 points for specifics AND what was done already to try to overcome them.
- **Desired discussion points (2 points):** 1 point for at least one relevant discussion point as a general question, 2 points for relevant discussion points with specifics.
- **Future Goals (2 points):** 1 point for concrete future targets (i.e. "working more on the project" is a zero, but "working on getting component X to interface with component Y" suffices), 2 points for tying in the targets with what was hopefully discussed in the meeting.
- **Time Spent (3 points):** 1 point for including general statements of how much time was spent ("4 hours on coding"), 2 points for splitting time into specific parts ("1.5 hours on research on component X, 1 hour coding, 2.5 hours debugging"), 3 points for specific parts and details on the pieces ("1.5 hours researching Turtle interface for drawing concentric circles given inputs from the user, 1 hour coding function X that used that interface, 2.5 hours testing function X by giving it multiple values and fixing errors for values A, B, C, and D").
- **Weekly Total Time (1 point)**
- **Total Project Time (2 points):** 1 point for summing the values correctly, 2 points for the total time AND reflection on progress (you are confident to fit the target and if not, what course corrections you anticipate needing to make).
